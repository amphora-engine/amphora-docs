# Amphora

Amphora is an exciting new game engine with a code-first focus.
It aims to be both simple and powerful, getting out of your way as much as possible and providing the canvas for your next masterpiece!

Amphora games are written in C or C++, with a powerful API for interfacing with the engine.
The engine is written in C17 and utilizes SDL2 to achieve near-seamless cross-platform compatibility.

The engine is distributed in source form along with all required build scripts, providing the utility of one-click builds as well as the flexibility of full easy access to the engine's internals.
The engine code is permissively licensed under the MIT license, placing no restrictions on how your game is distributed.
