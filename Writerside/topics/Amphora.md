# Amphora

Amphora is a 2D game engine with a code-first focus.
It aims to be both simple and powerful, getting out of your way as much as possible and providing the canvas for your next masterpiece!
It also supports a rich modding paradigm with the engine itself being a swappable component, allowing custom builds to be used without the need for recompilation.

Amphora games are written in modern C++, with a powerful API for interfacing with the engine.
The engine is written in C and utilizes SDL2 to achieve near-seamless cross-platform compatibility.

The engine code is permissively licensed under the MIT license, placing no restrictions on how your game is distributed.
